## What Inspired Me to Create YouTube Time Saver

I'm subscribed to numerous YouTube channels, and every day, more and more videos are released. Many of these videos, I simply don't have the time to watch. The problem is, even when I do manage to watch a video, it often turns out to be filled with useless information. Worse still, sometimes I end up feeling emotionally irritated, annoyed, or even worse after watching a video, which is something I definitely don't want.

This frustration led to the idea of using AI to generate video summaries. With this tool, I could get the key takeaways and main points of a video without having to watch it in its entirety. Through specific queries, I could delve deeper into the parts that interested me, and only if it was worth it, I would spend my time watching the full video. Beyond saving time, this approach also protected me from the emotional rollercoasters that some YouTubers can induce.
